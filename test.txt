- Maximum issues raised in Endorsements group (6,449 out of 16,476), 
    with a highest Issue Per requester ratio of 3.33x, where average Issue 
    raised per requester is 2.44.
- By Group: Highest load is over Endorsements Group issues whereas least load 
    is over Onboardings Group issues.
- Let's Check how many non null values we have in whole dataset. 
    This will help to identify least populated variable in the dataset
    which should be taken into consideration.
- By Status:  Endorsements Group has most Solved  ~40% of Total Solved Issues (2139).

- 74.5% of all issues have been Closed. Where only 13% of all issues were solved.

Found out that: 
columns : 
-  "Solved at",
-  "Resolution time", 
-  'Full resolution time in minutes', &
-  'Full resolution time in minutes within business hours'...
these have same number of non null values ( i.e.,  14409)*

and least non null values were noticed in* columns- 
-  "Satisfaction Score" (i.e,  5453)
    
- Mannual Tagging of Catagories have "-" about 13923 times that should be condered later.
- Comparing "Solved At" and " Satisfaction score" to see if there is any relation?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

- Found out that all the null Satifaction Score rows has Solved at also null.
May conclude to that- All the missing Satisfaction Score rows are never been solved

    let's point the insights for the Satisfaction score in whole data:

# Questions to be noted from Data: #
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q1. People with incomplete resolution even after reopening of their issues.
Q2. Difference between the full time resolution and first time resolution timing. Compare by  Department, Priority, Status, Via.
Q3. And how many people are there who are getting a need to reopen their issues and they do not get full revolution even after they getting reopened?
Q4. Reopening based on categories.
Q5. Why Repopening and Replies relation  +0.37 and not nearly 1. Which department or which category doesnt reply according to the reopenings. 
Q6. Satisfaction Score vs other factors.
